So anyways. Here's my dots. I hope you like them.

# Niklas's Nixflakes

## Flake Structure
Modules are grouped to be ***almost*** purely *functional* and as a result you will often find both the system configuration and the home-manager configuration in the same place. Not all NixOS users use this paradigm.

This repo has become more opinionated over time and now requires passing down variables from the `flake.nix` in order to fetch appropriate `host` and `user` specific configurations for a given device.
